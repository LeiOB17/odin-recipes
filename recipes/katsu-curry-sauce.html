<p><h3>Create a delicious katsu curry sauce recipe that is the perfect accompaniment for crispy breaded chicken, rice and prawn crackers</h3></p>
<p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
<ul>
        <li>1 tbsp	groundnut or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>5 whole garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>3 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp medium/mild curry powder</li>
       <li> 600ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 tsp honey</li>
       <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp	garam masala</li>
</ul>
<p><h2>Cooking Steps</h2></p>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a small pan.</li>
    <li>Add the onion and garlic and saut√© for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the carrots and sweat the vegetables slowly for 10 minutes with the lid on, stirring occasionally. </li>
    <li>Stir in the flour, curry powder, garam masala and cook for a minute.</li>
    <li>Slowly pour in the stock bit by bit until combined (do this gradually to avoid getting lumps).</li>
    <li>Add the honey and soy sauce and bring to the boil</li>
    <li> Reduce the heat to a slow simmer and cook for 20 minutes (the sauce will have thickened and taken on all of the flavours, although you still need it to have a pouring consistency).</li>
    <li> Pass the sauce through a sieve for a chunkier sauce or blend for a smoother sauce.</li>
</ol>
